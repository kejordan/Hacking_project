Things we need to focus on before weekend:

App part of presentation
Making sessions work in current version of app
Deploying current app to Heroku/other server for hacking purposes
Practicing hacking/take video of hacking using fireSheep

History part of presentation
Decide on specific/relevant hacking history (I think phreaking is most relevant)
  - phreaking deals with stealing a key (noise, light pulse, frequencies) to
    gain access to a system (cap'n crunch whistle, potentiometer on strobe)
Complete history portion of slides
Complete speech portion of history slides

Hacking part of presentation:
